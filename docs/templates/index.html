          <h4>Conditional Execution</h3>
          <p>lmfa0 gives you the ability to eliminate trivially pointless script executions in CI that would be difficult to express otherwise.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="three columns">
          <h4>Smart Diffing</h3>
          <p>lmfa0 exploits your CI cache to remember the last time it successfully executed a command for that specific path on your current branch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="three columns">
          <h4>Treat Paths Individually</h4>
          <p>Create as many rules as you want for different paths in your repository to maximize the benefits of lmfa0</p>
        </div>

        <div class="three columns">
          <h4>Easy Deployment</h4>
          <p>lmfa0 is a compiled Rust program with no runtime dependency's except glibc. No need to setup Python, Node, Ruby, or JVM.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p class="four columns">Only changing your TypeScript backend server, but don't want to wait for webpack to rebuild and test your React SPA? lmfa0's got your back.</p>
        <p class="four columns">Tweaking your firewall rules in your terraform, but don't want to wait for all the frontend and backend tests to run? lmfa0's got your back</p>
        <p class="four columns">Pushing a change to your style guide shouldn't mean waiting 45 minutes for ALL the integration tests, build steps, and infrastructure checkins to complete.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You create "rules" that connect a root path to a shell command</li>
          <li>When lmfa0 is invoked with a rule, it will create a diff from its last run on this branch</li>
          <li>If any files changed in that diff matching the root path, lmfa0 runs the command</li>
          <li>Finally lmfa0 updates its record of the last successful run for that rule in the .lmfa0/ directory</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Why do you need lmfa0 to generate this diff?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>lmfa0 solves the problem of figuring out what to diff against in two important cases:
            within a branch and at merge-time across branches.</p>
            <p>Within a branch, lmfa0 can gate CI steps to only rerun jobs that have changed since your last push
            speeding up your iteration. If you simply used the logic
            <code>if [[ -n "$(git diff master -- terraform/)"]]</code> you would rerun unnecessary steps 
            from one push to the next within that branch.</p>
            <p>At merge time, CI generally doesn't know where the head of master (or any other branch!) was
            prior to the merge. This makes it very tough to determine what changed inside a PR from a script
            in CI. lmfa0 remembers this information by storing in a per-branch cache because lmfa0 stores the git
            sha of the last successful run. Diffing between two git shas is easy, and lmfa0 does this part
            for you too.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>What if my script fails when lmfa0 runs it?</dt>
          <dd><p>lmfa0 will propagate whatever exit code your shell command returns as it own exit code.
          This makes it safe to use lmfa0 to start your test suite. However, lmfa0 will <em>not</em>
          update the git sha for the last run. (If you need control over whether the git sha is updated
          for nonzero exit codes, file an issue and I'll happy add this feature.)</p></dd>
          <dt>Isn't this potentially dangerous?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Yes! You need understand your own CI pipelines well enough to know when lmfa0 is a sane
            optimistization. Here's how I try to discover a "safe" bit of my CI to use lmfa0 on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Look through the timing on your recent CI jobs for a slow step</li>
              <li>Try to identify CI runs where that step didn't need to execute</li>
              <li>Ask yourself if you can determine purely based on paths in a diff if you could safely determine
                whether or not that step needed to execute</li>
              <li>Experiment with using an lmfa0 rule on that step instead of directly running whatever command exists</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes it's also possible to decouple bits of your CI so that it becomes safe to use lmfa0.
            A simple example would be reorganizing your directory structure so that you can craft a rule
            to target two logic components of your repo with separate lmfa0 rules. A more complex Rust-specific
            example would be separating concerns into different crates within a workspace.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Why can't I use environment variables in lmfa0 <code>command</code>s?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>lmfa0 is at an early stage of development and it was easier to skip this feature. If you would like to contribute this feature, open a pull request!</p>
            <p>As a workaround, lmfa0 will pass its environment to the command it executes, so create a shell script for lmfa0 to run which uses environment variables. Then have lmfa0 use your shell script as the command</p>
